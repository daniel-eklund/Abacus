# Abacus

This is an abacus + learning portal ran through the web.
I don't host it, therefore if you would like to try it, you will have to localhost.

Controls are mouse, and arrow keys. The selected bead will be lit as to not cause confusion.
Signing in is any user-name and password entered (not stored!), as there isn't an actual
user database, just an entrybox. This will allow you to try out the lessons included with
the project.
